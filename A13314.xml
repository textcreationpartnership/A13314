            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<note place="margin">C. p. 5</note> becauſe they giue not thankes to God for any of thoſe thinges they ſo plentifullie and aboundantlie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy. For thus hee threatneth them: Woe bee to you that riſe vp earlie to follovve drunkenneſſe, &amp; to drink til the euening till you chafe at the vvine. The Harpe, the Lute, the Organ and the pipe, is at your bankets, but you nothing regard the actes of the Lord, nor yet conſider his handie vvorke: that is, you lifte not your mindes and eies vp to him, from vvhoſe bountifulnes and liberalitie theſe things come.

But verie inconſideratelie do they and without regard of their yeares, who vntime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and vnſeaſonably enter into it before their ſtrength be tried, and the force of nature approoued. For there are ſome with almoſt neuer a haire on their faces, who either through ſome inconſiderate raſhneſſe, or being prouoked thereto by the allurementes of vvomen, or elſe by the compulſion of their parentes, gaping for ſome great dowrie, doe vndergoe this yoke: ſo that I haue beene forced to vſe applications to ſtrengthen and recouer verie many of them: but a little while after their mariages, before one yeare vvas co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men about, they haue beene ſo vveake and feeble limmed, and ſo
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:23921:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>conſumed their liuelie moiſture, that they were ſcarſe able to ſtande on their legges. Wherefore leaſt chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or thoſe that haue a little paſſed that age, ſhould applie their mindes to marriage: let euery one make trial of his ſtrength, and ſee of vvhat force he is in the loynes, and vvhat hee is able to indure. And whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer purpoſeth to giue himſelfe to marrie, lette him marke this aboue all other thinges: that hee take one to be his yoak-fellovv, which is of an honeſt houſe, not ſo much for her Dovvrie (albeit that is not to be refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed when it is profered) as for her vvit, honeſtie, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitie, baſhfulneſſe, and good manners. For a woman (as the Comicall Poet ſaith) hath a ſufficient Dowrie, if ſhe bee indued with good manners: And notable is that ſaying of <hi>Alcumena</hi> in <hi>Plautus,</hi>

               <p>Wherefore let parents carefullie labour prouident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to inſtruct that weake ſexe, and readie to fall to deſtruction, eſpeciallie vvhen they begin to wax ripe and readie for a husbande, that they conceiue no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſtie, nor ſuſtaine the loſſe of their chaſtitie,

Among ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny faults and errors which are wont to be committed in the entrance into this eſtate of wedlocke, there are three eſpeciallie which in my iudgement are to be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, becauſe from thence do many inconueniences ariſe. The firſt is, that the moſt part of men &amp; women doe enter into this kind of life, raſhlie and without con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſideration, hauing no regarde of their natures, but at ſuch an age as is altogether vnfit for it. Secondly, there are many that marrie when it is too late, and therefore out of ſeaſon, becauſe their age begins to wither, and yeares grow faſt vpon them. Laſtlie, there are ſome that match themſelues vnequallie, as one that is ſound and luſtie, vvith one that is ſicklie and vveake: a young man that marrieth an olde vvoman for her Dovvrie, which is an vnequall matche, and an olde man mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching with a young maiden, vvhich is not ſo much to be blamed as the other, becauſe it is not contrarie to the courſe and order of nature: for there are manie old menne, vvho though they bee craſie, yet is their age ſo liuelie, that they vvant not abilitie to get children: vvhich is altogether denied to olde and ouervvorne vvomen. And as the ouermuch haſte and celeritie of young men in thinking of marriage, is to bee blamed: ſo is ſlackneſſe and delaie in thoſe that are of yeares ſufficient.</p>
               <p>For thoſe that ſuffer themſelues to be tied with this yoke too haſtilie before they are readie, and before
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:23921:62"/>their bodies are ſtrong enough to indure it, it cannot be, but after a bragge or tvvo, their courage is cooled and altogether decaied: But thoſe that by delaies, let the lavvful time of marryage ouerſlip them, and defer their purpoſe to marrie till they be old, they lead a fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie and vnpleaſant life, yea and manie times defile themſelues vvith diuers and vnlawfull copulations: and that doe ſo manie pockyfaced, ſo manie diſeaſed, vvithered viſaged, bleare eied, crooked, gowtie and ſwolne legged companions ſhew vnto vs: who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvards when their liues beginne to be loathſome vnto them, and that it happen they ioine themſelues in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, they fall into manie and greate griefes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combrances.

               <p>For why a womans minde is nothing ſo ſtrong and valiaunt as a mans, neither commeth ſhee any thing neare him in wiſedome, but vppon euerie light occaſion, and for a matter of no waight at all, ſhee ſo looſeth the rayns of reaſon, that like a mad dogge for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting hirſelfe and al honeſty without any difference or regard of perſons, ſetteth vpon and teareth in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as well hir friends as her foes. And here if any man aske me why ſhee is ſo furious, I take this to bee one natural cauſe, in that a woman hath ſuch ſoft, tender, thinne and moiſt fleſh, that ſo ſoone as choler is kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in hir, it preſentlie ſetteth the heart on fire, and is quickely diſperſed ouer the whole body. For as fire doth quicklie conſume the light ſtubble, the which for the time maketh a great blaſing flame, but ſoone go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out and quickelie vaniſheth: euen ſo is a woman ſoon kindled with anger, &amp; once incenſed doth rage in extremity, and becauſe hir body is neither ſtrong nor coragious, hir anger becauſe of hir moiſture is ſoon ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>peaſed &amp; ended, quenching hir fury with a few fooliſh
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:23921:81"/>and childiſh teares. But if the cauſe of this their mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe may be ſearched more neare to the quicke, I find there is nothing ſo much incenſeth their anger as that venemous ſcumme and filthie ſincke of humors, which they monethly gather and purge according to the courſe of the moon. For if a woman happen neare the time of that diſeaſe to bee prouoked to anger (as ſmall things then will greatly offend them) the whole ſinke of that filth being ſtirred doth fume and diſperſe it ſelfe ouer the body: whereby it falleth out that the heart and braine being affected and troubled with the ſmoake and ſparks of that moſt odious excrement, the ſpirites both vitall and animall that are ſeruiceable to thoſe parts, are inflamed, when if you prouoke and ſtir the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on to anger, eſpeciallie thoſe women that are yong (for they that are old and ouerworne, and who are paſt hauing ſuch diſeaſes, ſome of them are more quiet by reaſon of coldeneſſe,) they will barke and brawle like ſnarling dogs, and clapping their hands together, wil not onely ſhew many vndecent geſtures, but alſo vtter very vncomly ſpeeches. And becauſe reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with them is of no force, their iudgments weake, and their minds feeble and infirme, they brawle and brabble with ſuch extremity that the rage of their mindes can bee by no good means quieted. And by how much y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more baſe euerie one is in that ſexe, by ſo much the more vnho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly wil ſhe braule with vnappeaſeable anger. Hence commeth it that proſtitutes &amp; the baſe ſort of women (for thoſe that are of any calling wil ſometimes regard decency, although at other ſeaſons (by their leaues) they wil wrinkle their noſes, or as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> countreyman ſaith niule like a Mare eating of thiſtles, and not aunſwere their husbands ſo much as one worde,) whoſe bodies for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt part are infected with il humors, do to their
